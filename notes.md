#### on windows machine you may get this cp1252.py error

```
File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "C:\ProgramData\miniconda3\Lib\encodings\cp1252.py", line 12, in encode
    return codecs.charmap_encode(input,errors,encoding_table)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
UnicodeEncodeError: 'charmap' codec can't encode character '\U0001f576' in position 0: character maps to <undefined>
encoding with 'cp1252' codec failed

C:\Users\Srika\AppData\Local\pypoetry\Cache\virtualenvs\youtube-yapper-trapper-xBqsal-M-py3.12\Lib\site-packages\crewai\the task.py (maybe **fixed by crewai in ver 0.30**)
was edited to resolve the charmap error on windows machine by changing
with open(self.output_file, "w") as file: --> with open(self.output_file, "w", encoding='utf-8') as file:

```
def _save_file(self, result: Any) -> None:
    with open(self.output_file, "w", encoding='utf-8') as file:
        file.write(result)
        # file.flush()  # Ensure data is written to the disk; maybe not necessary
    return None
```

to save the report with date and time stamp so that we can compare the reports
generated by LLM models used.
***if other location ***
output_file=f"C:/Users/Srika/Desktop/Reports/Report-{suffix_datetime}.md"

this code in main.py was used **when the above charmap error happened** some of the time, hence
commented
#output_file="Report.md" #filename

```
    result = crew.crew().kickoff(inputs=inputs)
    print("Analysis Result:")
    print(result) #.encode("utf-8"))

    # new code as follows

    # Get the current date and time
    current_datetime = datetime.now()
    # Format the date and time in a specific format, e.g., YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM
    formatted_datetime = current_datetime.strftime("%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M")
    # Use the formatted date and time in the filename
    filename = f"Report_{formatted_datetime}.md"

    # print(f"Writing to {filename}") # Check the path where the file is being written

    # Open a new file with the dynamic filename in write mode
    with open(filename, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as file:
        # Write the Markdown content to the file
        file.write(result)
        file.flush()  # Ensure data is written to the disk; maybe not necessary
```
